My Frontend Capstone Project:

Flashcard-o-matic
A local school has decided to put together a flash card application, Flashcard-o-matic, to help their students study online. 
Teachers will use this application to create decks of flash cards for the subjects that they teach, and students will study the decks.


Project setup
Follow the instructions below to get this project up and running on your own machine:
-Run npm install to install the project.
-Run npm start to start Flashcard-o-matic

The start command will start two servers concurrently:

An API server, powered by json-server, running on http://localhost:5000
A React application running on http://localhost:3000
To stop the servers from running, you can press Control+C.
